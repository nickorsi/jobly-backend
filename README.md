<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a RESTful API built using node/express to interact with a Postgres database. This API was built as the backend to be used by the [Jobly](https://github.com/nickorsi/react-ts-jobly-fronted-vite) frontend repo. Some of the features this API includes:
* Registers and authenticates users safely with the use of bcrypt hashing
* Uses JWT validation to authenticate and authorize users
* Throughly tested code with 99% coverage


The code is provided courtesy of [Rithm School](https://www.rithmschool.com/) as part of the curriculum material.

The API has the following endpoints:
* Authentication Routes:
  * ```POST/auth/register```: Registers a user providing valid data.
  * ```POST/auth/token```: Authenticates user via a validated JWT.
* Companies Routes:
  * ```POST/companies```: Adds a company with valid data.
  * ```GET/companies```: Retrieves all companies, can provide a search filter.
  * ```GET/companies/[handle]```: Retrieves a specified company.
  * ```PATCH/companies/[handle]```: Updates a specified company.
  * ```DELETE/companies/[handle]```: Deletes a specified company.
* Job Routes:
  * ```POST/jobs```: Adds a job with valid data.
  * ```GET/jobs```: Retrieves all jobs, can provide a search filter.
  * ```GET/jobs/[handle]```: Retrieves a specified job.
  * ```PATCH/jobs/[handle]```: Updates a specified job.
  * ```DELETE/jobs/[handle]```: Deletes a specified job.
* User Routes:
  * ```POST/jobs```: Adds a job with valid data.
  * ```GET/jobs```: Retrieves all jobs, can provide a search filter.
  * ```GET/jobs/[handle]```: Retrieves a specified job.
  * ```PATCH/jobs/[handle]```: Updates a specified job.
  * ```DELETE/jobs/[handle]```: Deletes a specified job.
